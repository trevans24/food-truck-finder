# Responses to the survey
## Interviewe #1 
1. Yelp -- see reviews how many stars, dislikes thed ads
1. Yes to find food but note to order, thought about starbucks, doesn’t have a problem with walking in and ordering
1. No -- thinks it would be cool to be able to find trucks
1. Yes, almost anytype of product not just food-- clothing, etc..
1. No
1. Highly rated over close
1. 10-15 min at maximum
1. Pretending to be an owner(why????) 
1. Yes
1. Yelp?
1. Emails, text messages?
### Notes: I felt as if high ratings were an important part of the decision making process… I think distance traveled to a restaurant should be determined in minutes, instead of miles.  Would you walk to a restaurant if it was 5 min walk or a 45 min walk?... I think the average user probably measures distance traveled anywhere by the time it takes to get where they want to go.
### I preceded with the owner questions just to hear more potential Ideas about what an owner might need.   I agree that its not the most practical approach, but I was just trying to

## Interviewee #2

1. Yelp. Allows see reviews, google maps offers the same thing but it doesn’t always provide info, can’t find food I want. Yelp is up to date.
1. Food type, price, categories.
1. Go straight to the food
1. No.
1. Want ASAP the kind of food I’m in the mood for, price is secondary. People just want food that they want. Filter by type of food, how far at this exact moment.
1. Eat out for convenience, not luxury. 

## Interviewee #4
1. Postmates, UberEats
1. “America” and it’s also convenient
1. When they get my order wrong and surge delivery fees
1. Yes
1. If I’m at a bar, but not otherwise.
1. No
1. Every f**king time. I look at Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, I look at all the pictures and their reviews.
1. What? Is there one.
1. Close first but not one with 1.5 stars.
1. Couch to door.
1. Pass
1. Google Maps
1. Social media
### Additional comments: I’d like if the app showed a little taco for a taco truck so I would know the type of food they offer.

### Takeaway: Convenience definitely seems to be key when it comes down to developing this food truck app. 

## Pasty Republic:
1. Heavy use of social media as twitter, FB, instagram, and yelp to let customers know where they are located. They clearly do not have any other apps that they use currently to reach out to other customers. Their website has them currently using GrubHub, uberEATS, and groupon to help promote their brand/truck.
1. On the business side they are using google calendar to keep a schedule of their locations and pretty much stick to their schedule. Their schedule via their site is for this week (5/1/17) shows them moving from Brewery to Brewery with an occasional Cidery here and there. They also do events and can be booked on their site.
1. They were intrigued to have an app that would integrate both google calendar and maps to help them reach out to their customers from an app that would make it convenient to have a wider market as there currently is not anything besides social media that the could use to help get more customers.

# Research Results
The market for food trucks in Denver is growing at an exponential amount every year. The problem however, is that most people do not know the type of food trucks out there, how many there are, or where these trucks are located. The trucks themselves have had to resort to using different social media outposts like FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram... just to hope to have a client base or customers who would be interested in finding them. If you are like me though, I do not go out of my way to find a food truck because frankly they aren't easy to find. Unless you are at a bar/brewery around Denver then you get used to seeing Food Trucks. The gap for truck owners and customers to connect is so vast in the Denver market that now there is time to have a tool that can bridge it for everyone.
So far the results have shown that there is a need for a way for people interested in food trucks to have a tool for them to find a food truck closest to them. The overwhelming issue is that there is not currently any known way for people to find them other than word of mouth and by seeing them randomly on the street. People whom currently use technology from our interviews to find restaruants use primarily google maps, postmates, and yelp. These apps have ease of use for people to find what they are looking for in established full scale restaurants and do not currently have up to date information or any information in regards to the food trucks. There clearly is a need for an app similar to those mentioned that solve the issue of finding trucks and having exposure to current seeking customers.
In the small research of the usage for trucks was very insightful. They currently have a bunch of other apps to try and reach out to customers but none that directly help connect the customer with the truck. Their expression in an app to reach out to customers and make it easier for them to be found by potential customers. They did have a interest to integrate with both google maps and google calendar to help them track where they are going. They would also like to consider having some way to reach out to their customers with social media integration as well.
